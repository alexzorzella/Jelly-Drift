# Shader Customization

The shadergraph version of this shader can be found under `Shader/Development`

Before using shadergraph version we need to modify some settings. Otherwise shaadergraph version will show pink.

### 1. Project Settings Setup

On the `Project Settings > Shadergraph` section, increase the `Shader variant limit` to `25000`.

### 1. Preferences Setup

On the `Preferences > ShaderGraph` section, increase the `Preview variant limit` to `25000`.

## Next step

Open the `UberStylizedWaterGraph` shadergraph and start customizing the shader.
THe shader uses a layer based system where each effect is layerd on top of the previous one to create the final water look.
